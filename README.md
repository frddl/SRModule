Speech Recognition in Flight Simulation. Senior Design Project by ADA University students - Ramil Hasanov, Elmin Gasimov, Farid Mammadov and Orkhan Jabrailov.
As a developed implementation to manual control of systems, Speech Recognition offers direct access to the most of the cockpit functions.
In this research project, we designed and demonstrated a prototype for Speech Recognition in Flight Simulation.
